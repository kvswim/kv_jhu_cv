I used NCC in this assignment. 
For feature detection: used radius 2 (window 5x5) and threshold of 6000
For ransac: threshold is <50 in an effort to get something, anything to match.
Features are capped at 1000, if there are more detected then we take a random sample.
All alignments are extremely poor. Changing the threshold does little to improve detection.
I believe this is because too many features are being detected, though I can't figure out why or how to turn it down.
Drawing side by side is weird, even though the offset is correct some points end up in the same side. 
Wall1 and Wall3 cannot be stitched because they are different dimensions, this will always cause a dimension error. 
Least square solving is very likely to return a singular matrix error.
Compute_proj_xform and ssift_descriptor are not done because this is 400 level.

I meant to be able to imwrite, but I could never get it to write images. So, this is display-only. PRESS ANY KEY TO CONTINUE.
